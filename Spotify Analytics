*** For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. 
*** Then I created a table to insert the Spotify data into. 
*** Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#1: Who are the 10 most popular artists? 

SELECT track_name, artist name, popularity 
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

#2: What is the most popular song, and what is its danceability?

SELECT track_name, popularity, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity, danceability
LIMIT 1


#3: What artist released the longest song? What was the song? 

SELECT duration_ms/1000, artist_name, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1

#4: What is the average 'danceability' of each artist? 

SELECT artist_name, avg(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
